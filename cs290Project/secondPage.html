<h3>
Background
</h3>
<p>
The path to the first chapionship was the very difficult. From getting Shaq in 2004 to a busy offseason in 2005, and even a change in coaching. The Heats seaon did not start off looking like a championship season.
</p>
<p>
The Miami heat drafted Dwane Wade in 2003 and they knew he was going to lead the team, the next season they aquired All Star Shaquille Onielfrom the LA Lakers. and they entered the 2004-5 season with high expectations. The season eneded going to seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, but eventually the heat lost then. 
</p>

<h3>
2005-2006 Season
</h3>
<p>
The season started off as a great dissapintment. They started off as 15-12 record. which is not something that the heat expected.The head coach, Stan van Gudny, even stepped down as the head coach at that time. The team was taken over by Pat Riley. The Heat then turned the season aound and became NBA champions.
</p>
<p>
I am too lazy to describe the whole title run so here is a super hyped up video from that season describing everything that happened.
