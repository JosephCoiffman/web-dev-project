<h3>
Who are the Heat?
</h3>
The <a href="https://www.nba.com/heat/home">Miami Heat</a> first played in the 1988-1989 season. After a bunch of mediocre years and drafting Dwane Wade and getting Shaquile Oniel in a trade the Heat won their first champoinship in 2006. Skip playoff teams later, in 2010 the Miami Heat managed to snag Lebron James and Chris Bosh in free agency to make what was known as the "Big Three". That led to four straight Finals appearences and 2 straight championships for the Miami Heat in 2012 1nd 2013.
