<h3>
Background
</h3>
<p>
The path to the second Champion was very unlikely. The Miami Heat (Pat Riley), managed to create the "Big Three". The team was a super team like no other, With Lebron James Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. But it wasn't all fun and games. In just the previous season, the 2011 season, the Heat were embarrased by the <a href="https://www.mavs.com/"> Dallas Mavs</a> and evryone was saying Lebron cannot win a champoinship.
</p>
<p>
The Miami heat then went on to beat the Thunder in a gentlemans sweep in 5 games. The next season.

<h3>
The 2012 season
</h3>
<p>
The season started went just as the Heat hoped and it ended with them becamoming NBA champions.
</p>
<p>
I am too lazy to describe the whole title run so here is a super hyped up video from that season describing everything that happened.

<h4>
Here is the roster from that season: (no, I do not remember the roster as I don't have that great memory, this information was found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Miami_Heat_season#Roster"> this wikipedia page</a>, notice how now for the positions there is no SG/PG just G, and no PF/SF just F)
